Project correctly reads from files and dynamically allocates size to fit input, 
correctly parses 1's and 0's from input, converts input to decimal, converts input to ascii, 
calculates parity, and calculates transmission error.
Remaining issue is won't wait to read user input for stdin.

8/29 set up a git in sandbox in git.pioneering.csun.edu
8/30 finished parse()
9/1 finished toDecimal() and toParity()
9/2 realized I was not using primitives to read files, began rewriting
9/4 finished printTable() and used read() to read from stdin and files
9/5 set up a git on github since I could not access git on git.pioneering.csun.edu
